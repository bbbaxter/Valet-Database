# Valet-Database

This is a small project that I worked on for a final project in my Databse Theory class. I got to choose, design, and create my own database that would satisfy the job that I created. I chose to make a Valet database because I had spent a summer working there and knew everything to create this database and hopefully create it better than the one they used.
